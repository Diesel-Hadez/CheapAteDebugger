# Introduction

The CheapAteDebugger is an emulator and debugger for the Chip8 system.[^1]

This book will cover the structure of the CheapAteDebugger source code, 
reasoning behind design choices, project environment setup, and future 
ideas for the project. 

The hope is that this book will be able to act as a reference and guide
to how to contribute to this project.

[^1]: And perhaps others in the future.
